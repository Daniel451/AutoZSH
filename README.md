# ZephyrZSH

ZephyrZSH is an open source configuration for the Z Shell that aims to
provide a quick start with a feature-rich `zsh` environment. It installs
oh-my-zsh together with several plugins and supplies a default `zshrc`
file.

## Prerequisites

The installer expects the following tools to be available:

- `zsh`
- `git`
- `curl`
- `fzy`
- `fzf`

## Running the installer

1. Clone this repository and open the directory.
2. Execute `./zephyr-install.sh`.
   - The script prompts for confirmation.
   - It invokes `zephyr-checkup.sh` to verify dependencies.
   - oh-my-zsh and all plugins are downloaded and installed locally.
   - Finally, the `zshrc` file is copied to `$HOME/.zshrc`.

## Checking dependencies

`zephyr-checkup.sh` can be run manually and is also used by the
installer to ensure all required commands are installed.

## Customizing your configuration

After installation the provided `zshrc` becomes your `$HOME/.zshrc`.
Feel free to modify this file to tailor themes, plugins or any other
settings to your preference.
