# AutoZSH

AutoZSH is an open source easy install & default configuration wrapper
for the Z Shell and [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh).
The project aims to
provide a quick start with a feature-rich `zsh` environment. It installs
`oh-my-zsh` together with several plugins and supplies a default `zshrc`
file featuring default key bindings and some custom functions.

## Prerequisites

The installer expects the following tools to be available:

- `zsh`
- `git`
- `curl`
- `fzy`
- `fzf`
- `zoxide`

## Running the installer

1. Clone this repository and open the directory.
2. Execute `./autozsh-install.sh`.
   - The script prompts for confirmation.
   - It invokes `autozsh-checkup.sh` to verify dependencies.
   - oh-my-zsh and all plugins are downloaded and installed locally.
   - Finally, the `zshrc` file is copied to `$HOME/.zshrc`.

## Checking dependencies

`autozsh-checkup.sh` is executed automatically by the installer but can be run manually, too. This script ensures all required commands are installed.

## Customizing your configuration

After installation the provided `zshrc` becomes your `$HOME/.zshrc`.
Feel free to modify this file to tailor themes, plugins or any other
settings to your preference.
